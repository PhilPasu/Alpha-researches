# Alpha Researches

This repository is my personal space to publish and document side research projects.  
The focus is on **crypto markets**, with an emphasis on strategies and ideas that aim to **seek alpha** — uncovering inefficiencies, building models, and testing hypotheses outside of my main academic work.

### What you’ll find here
- Exploratory research notebooks  
- Quantitative ideas on trading strategies 
- Experiments that may later evolve into more formal papers or strategies  

> ⚡ This is an evolving sandbox — expect drafts, iterations, and plenty of experiments.
